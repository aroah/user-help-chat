Each alert included in the cascade has a separate recipient list (contacts, groups, or \nschedules), message, response options, device priority, and advanced settings. A cascaded alert \ncan be sent based on the response from an initial message or a multiple- choice follow -up question.  \nCascade can be used by disaster recovery teams and business continuity planners to make \ncommunications with multiple groups of people more efficient and easier to manage. For example, \nthis two -tiered quota alert uses cascading to react to an emergency: A c ompany\u2019s Facilities Manager \nneeds to determine whether the building should be evacuated due to an emergency and sends  an \nalert to the Building Manager (Tier 1). If the response from the query is \u201cYes, start evacuation procedures now,\u201d a cascading alert is automatically launched to all employees in that building \n(Tier 2) with instructions to evacuate.  \nA broadcast alert that uses cascading could include a questionnaire with branched responses based \non an initial set of questions. For example, a broadcast cascade alert can be used at a restaurant \nwith a long line of waiting customers to manage seating shortages. A broadcast alert can be sent to \nthe waiting customers in case of a longer wait time than anticipated and allow them to opt  out of their \nreservation or continue to wait, allowing the restaurant to juggle the seating shortages and keep \ncustomers from feeling forgotten while waiting.  \nThe cascade feature is a powerful communication tool , but an alert can spiral out of control quickly if \nnot properly planned. Map out the entire cascade so there is no mistake as to who gets  each alert, \nwho can respond, and what happens when the response is registered. Preplanning can be \nespecially useful if one cascading alert continues to cascade to subsequent alerts.  \nFor instance, this example results in an unexpectedly large number of alerts being sent: A broadcast \nalert is delivered to 200 recipients. Response 1 includes the cascade option to trigger a subsequent \nalert to Group B. 150 of the 200 recipients respond with Response 1, and each response triggers the cascading alert to Group B. Recipients in Group B are sent the same cascading alert 150 times.  \nNote that if the intent is that only one responder is expected to send the cascade of further \nresponses, then the cascade is best served using the Quota alert method. This method ensures that \nonly one individual can respond and launch the cascade. In a Broadcast alert, all recipients can \nrespond simultaneously, with each user possibly launching the cascade, resulting in many  undesired \nduplicate alerts.

The \nText-to-Enroll feature enables people to send a keyword (a single SMS message) to an SMS short \ncode to gain access to their account portal or public enrollment portal. The OnSolve Platform replies \nwith a URL to allow people record updates via a mobile web browser.  \n \nOrganizations can use Text -to-Enroll to allow existing contacts to update their contact data or use it \nas a way to add new contacts to their contact database through a configured account portal. Text -to-\nEnroll can also be used by state and local government  customers who want to give people a chance \nto receive alerts for weather or local emergencies. After the keyword is texted, the system sends a URL directing subscribers  to a public enrollment portal to register to receive alerts.  \nSMS Opt -In (Private) allows administrators to create a keyword that anyone can use to opt  in to \ngroups or topics to receive alerts related to those keyword topics. For example, a hotel chain might \nuse an SMS Opt -In (Private) keyword to allow guests to opt  in to get emergency alerts during their \nstay if an emergency occurs where they need to evacuate the premises.  \n", "290": "Subscriptions  | Text-to-Keyword  \nProprietary & Confidential |  OP Admin Guide, New Groups Flow  | v8.3 290 \nSMS Opt -In (Public) allows  the general public  to get public -facing notifications with an SMS keyword. \nFor example, attendees at a county fair could opt  in to get alerts to learn about events happening \nwhile they are there.  \n \nThe different types of TTK \u2014Text -to-Enroll, SMS Opt -In (Private), and SMS Opt -In (Public) \u2014all \nrequire the same steps to set up.

For SMS Opt -In (Private and Public) , the account must \nfirst have at least one topic or one group (see Topics in Section 6 and Create and Manage Groups  in \nSection 2 of this guide).

These roles can be assigned directly to users. They are not deletable,  and their \nnames are uneditable . While these are predefined generic  roles to get customers started, customers \nare encouraged to create custom roles so that the permissions given to each role are known.  \nAdministrator  \nThe administrator is the top- level user role responsible for administering and customizing an \norganization\u2019s account with little or no restrictions on system features, functions, and data. \nAdministrators are users with access to all OnSolve role permissions.  \nAdministrators have full access to system functionality, as well as responsibility for the operation and \nmaintenance of the system. Administrators may create roles and divisions and,  in a future release, \ngrant access to the Billing module. Multiple administrator roles may also be created with varying \nlevels of permissions.  \nAdministrators for the OnSolve Platform are responsible for the day -to-day administration of the \nplatform , where the permissions and rights are established at the highest level of the hierarchical \ntree (referred to as the organization). Administrator rights are inherited throughout the organization\u2019s \n", "319": "Configure | Permissions   \nProprietary & Confidential |  OP Admin Guide, New Groups Flow  | v8.3 319 \ntree structure, so their role\u2019s permissions give them the authority to view and maintain the entire \nstructure.  \nAn organization\u2019s administrator(s) can create and maintain the Organization\u2019s hierarchical tree structure by using divisions and subdivisions. Divisions and subdivisions help partition senders in a \nspecific division or subdivision (including their contacts , groups, schedules, map groups, reports, and \nalerts) from seeing (or accessing) other initiators and their contacts, groups, schedules, reports, and \nalerts. This provides security and prevents Initiators from seeing or inadvertently sending alerts to \nthe wrong people.  \nAdministrators can create custom user roles by applying specific permissions to the created roles. \nAdditionally, they can import user data into the OnSolve Platform  using the Import Contacts tool. See \nthe OnSolve Platform Import Contacts  guide for more information.  \nAdditional responsibilities may include:  \n\u2022 Create custom modifications to the OnSolve Platform  with pre- canned verbiage and instructions.  \n\u2022 Edit or protect user data fields.  \n\u2022 View the OnSolve Platform as other users (View as User).  \n\u2022 Adjust PBX Call Throttling.  \n\u2022 Define Automated Number Identifiers (Caller IDs).  \n\u2022 Establish global Extended Option defaults for the alert parameters and values.  \n\u2022 Build group queries and export reports.  \n\u2022 View billing and transaction information, and view audit logs.  \n\u2022 Create pronunciations (phonetic word replacements used by the TTS engine).  \n\u2022 Modification of the TTS delivery speed.  \nInitiator  \nInitiators or senders are users with permissions to send alerts. They may create, edit, assign, and \nsend alerts within the system. Initiators can also view the recipients who receive the alerts.  \nAccess to system functions usually consists of only those necessary to perform job duties. While the \nOnSolve Platform Organization/Division administrators are responsible for day -to-day maintenance \nof the platform, the Initiator is responsible for day -to-day alert activity.  \nAn initiator\u2019s primary role is defined as a user who is authorized to create and send alerts. They can \nbuild Broadcast , Quota, and Bulletin Board alerts and send them with normal/high priority.  ", "320": "Configure | Permissions   \nProprietary & Confidential |  OP Admin Guide, New Groups Flow  | v8.3 320 \nInitiators may also be responsible for creating contacts, groups, and schedules. In this release, data \ncan be entered through the user interface. Future releases will include more options for data \nmanagement. Initiators may also have the rights to add or remove contacts from groups  and \nschedules.  \nInitiators may also be responsible for creating preconfigured alert templates and incorporating \nplaceholders within templates, which require minimal steps before sending. They\u2019re responsible for \nconfiguring and verifying settings for contact strategies, la nguages, Advanced Settings, Follow -Up \nQuestions, and Cascade before launching an alert to ensure all the features are correctly used.  \nMore advanced Business Continuity Plans (BCP) and emergency responders (initiators) use \nfeatures like the proactive Cascade for their Business Continuity Plans. They also deploy Topic \nSubscription for NetOps, IT, or Help Desk Users. Other initiator duties may include setting up \nConference Bridge alerts for emergency meetings, creating personalized voice- recorded alerts, and \npossibly developing follow -up surveys to monitor and gauge the alert experience.  \nSpecific initiator roles (e.g. , limited initiator, sub -initiator , or restricted initiator) can be created based \non the division, or subdivision, where the initiator resides. Some initiator roles, for example, may be limited and unable to delete contacts, alerts, or reports. Additionally, they may not be able to see \nuser device information marked as private or to edit specific  protected fields in people records. \nCustom roles can change because not all initiators need access to every feature or function. For \nsecurity reasons or simplicity, administrators may restrict the role\u2019s permissions.  \nIn some organizations , the initiator might assume some (or all) administrator responsibilities . Still,  \nwith most government and Fortune 500 organizations, the initiator will not have access to \nadministrator functions, including importing and exporting contact data.  \nRecipient  (Contact)  \nRecipients may receive alerts as defined by the system administrator. Recipients may or may not \nhave access to the user interface.  \nNote:  The name for this role is \u201cRecipient\u201d when managing roles from the Configure  > Permissions \n> Roles or Add Role  pages. The name for this role is \u201cContact\u201d in all other places in the user \ninterface.  \nRecipients are contacts who may receive alerts on multiple devices. No permissions are required to receive an alert, except for alerts sent to subscribers using the Topic Subscription feature. The \nrecipient is the individual who receives the alert. The goal is to get the recipient to receive the alert \non the devices listed in their people record and respond if requested.  \nWhile some organizations grant system login access to recipients to update and maintain their user \nprofile, those that use DataSync or an Account Portal generally do not grant login access because \nthe Human Resources department maintains the user data.

The app is available for both iOS and Android devices.  \nThere are two ways to use the OnSolve Mobile app:  \n\u2022 Recipients only. Authorized recipients can sign into the OnSolve Mobile app with either an SMS \nphone number or an email address. They can then use the app to check in, send an SOS, report \nan incident as it occurs (LookOut), or receive an alert.  \n\u2022 Authorized senders. Authorized senders sign in with the same username and password as the \nweb UI. Almost every task that can be completed via the OnSolve Platform web user interface \ncan also be completed using OnSolve Mobile. Additionally, authorized senders can send an \nSOS, use the Life Check timer, or report an incident as it occurs. When logged in as a sender, \nyou can toggle to the Recipients interface and receive alerts.  \nSince all received alerts are stored in recipients\u2019 Alert Inboxes, recipients can retrieve alerts via the \napp no matter the alert sender\u2019s selected delivery methods. Once signed in, tap the Inbox icon at the \nbottom of the dashboard. However, if the sender chooses the mobile app as a delivery method, \nrecipients with the app do not need to actively retrieve it and, instead, see the alert (or push notification) on their phones.  \nWhen creating an alert, senders can select the mobile app delivery method (if not already selected \nby default). Recipients then receive the alert via the app if they have downloaded it and are signed \nin. Recipients can even receive the alert if the app is closed, in which case a push notification is sent \nto the phone, so alerts are not missed.  \nTo learn how to use OnSolve Mobile, please see the OnSolve Mobile User Guide.  \nGeofenced -Enabled Alerts  \nIn addition to standard alerting methods where the sender selects the recipients from a list or group, \nOnSolve offers location- based alerts with map groups. Map groups pull recipients into a group based \non location and can be created via the Groups page or  the Control Center m ap. Map groups work in \ntwo ways, the difference being at what point the OnSolve Platform queries contacts\u2019 locations:  \n\u2022 Geofence- enabled . A map group with geofence enabled includes all contacts with static \nlocations saved in their people record in the map shape and all OnSolve Mobile app users in the \nmap shape, provided Mobile App is a selected delivery method. If a static location that falls \nwithin the map shape is added to a contact\u2019s record after the alert has been sent , but while the \nalert is still active, the contact receives the alert when their new location is saved. Likewise, if an OnSolve Mobile app user is outside the geofence when the alert is sent but enters the geofence \nwhile the alert is still active, they receive the alert once they enter the geofence.
